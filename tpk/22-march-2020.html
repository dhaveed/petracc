                                    For the next few weeks we will learn trust in God from the life of David.
                                    David trusted God as a shepherd, giant fighter, in hiding, and in the palace. We can
                                    learn much from David’s life, and so can your child.
                                    <br><br>

                                    Today’s story is about David’s reliance on God in the early years of life. We will
                                    see in the weeks to come that David continued to trust the
                                    Lord throughout his life. Talk with your child about times that he or she has
                                    trusted you as a parent to take care of and protect him or her.
                                    <br><br>

                                    Say: “In our true story from the Bible today we will learn about how a shepherd boy
                                    could trust God so much that he was able to do
                                    amazing things. Listen for what this young shepherd could do with God’s help.”Open
                                    your Bible to 1 Samuel 16 and tell the story.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Getting to know God more helps us trust Him more. In quiet moment, our alone times,
                                    we can spend reading our Bible and praying more so we can know Him more.

                                    David Was a Shepherd Boy <br>
                                    (1 Samuel 16:6-12; 17:12-15, 34-36)

                                    <p>
                                        Long ago, during the days of King Saul and the prophet Samuel, there lived a
                                        young boy named David. David lived in Bethlehem with his father, Jesse, and his
                                        seven older brothers. Three of his brothers were soldiers in Saul’s army. David,
                                        however, stayed home and helped his father. One of David’s jobs was to care for
                                        the sheep. Men who did this were called shepherds. A shepherd moved his sheep
                                        from place to place so the animals always would have green grass and fresh
                                        water. On nights when the flock was far from the shepherd’s home, the shepherd
                                        would sleep on the hillside to watch over it. Probably there were many nights
                                        when David looked at the stars and the moon and thought about the beautiful
                                        world God had made. He may have learned to play his harp on the hill, and he
                                        probably wrote many songs as he watched the sheep.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Serving as a shepherd boy, David learnt a lot about how God watches over us like
                                        a shepherd watches his sheep. He learned to trust God in everything. He even
                                        wrote a song about God being our shepherd (Psalms 23). In those precious times
                                        alone with sheep, David prayed a lot to God and got to know Him more. Ho grew to
                                        trust God so much that he was able to do great things!
                                        <br><br>
                                        For example, one time a lion carried off one of David’s sheep. David ran after
                                        it, caught it, and killed it! He had confidence that God would give him the
                                        strength to rescue the sheep. Another time a bear came and stole one of his
                                        sheep. David ran after a bear and killed it too! A day came when he killed a
                                        great big giant that every other person was afraid of!

                                        What things today could make us afraid? Can we trust God to protect us even with

                                    Make a Lion’s Head
                                    <ol>
                                        <li
                                            style="list-style-type: decimal !important; font-size: 16px; margin: 10px 5px 5px 0px;">
                                            Make a collage lion head, using paper or ropes or fabric. Simply draw the
                                            outline of a lion’s head (it doesn’t have to be perfect) and let the
                                            children have fun sticking pieces of yarn or paper strips to make the mane.
                                            This is sure to keep them busy – and perhaps quiet!
                                        </li>
                                        <li
                                            style="list-style-type: decimal !important; font-size: 16px; margin: 10px 5px 5px 0px;">
                                            Use whatever you have around the house with a round shape (paper plate,
                                            construction paper, etc.) Cut the edges into strips and curl them just a bit
                                            for the lion’s mane. Glue on wiggly eyes or just draw the eyes. Color or
                                            glue on a fabric nose and mouth.
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>

                                    For extra effect, you can attach the lion head to an empty toilet paper roll painted
                                    yellow.

                                <p>
                                    Psalm 23 (reduce the number of verses depending on the age of the child)
                                    <ol>
                                        <li

                                            Write down the words of the verse to be memorized on different pieces of
                                            paper. If learning the entire chapter, make it sentences. Have the children
                                            fix up the pieces as a jigsaw puzzle.
                                        </li>
                                        <li

                                            Take turns as a family reciting the verse(s) morning and evening.
                                        </li>
                                        <li

                                            If learning the entire chapter, have the children draw a picture to
                                            represent each verse, and write the verse beneath it. Show them the pictures
                                            in order to remind them – or paste it by their bedside.

                                    Put the family into teams. <br>
                                    Use a rope/line made with tape to demarcate one end of the room. <br>
                                    Blow up some balloons and draw sheep face on them <br>
                                    Each participant holds a rod made of rolled-up paper. <br> <br>
                                    The aim of the game is to herd as many sheep as possible from one end of the room to
                                    the other end that is demarcated.
                                    To make it more difficult for the adults, allow the children try to blow the balloon
                                    away from them.
                                    The team with the most balloons in at the end of the timed period wins.

                                    <br><br>
                                    Alternatively, in the absence of balloons, roll up paper into balls, or simply use
                                    balls of cotton wool, and try to blow the paper balls into the demarcated area using
                                    a straw.
